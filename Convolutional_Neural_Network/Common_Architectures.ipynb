    "Simply described, a Convolutional Neural Network is a type of Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network in which - some of - hidden layers are structured in such a way that their output on a given input is a convoluted version of input data using a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of Neural Networks are powerful in Image Analysis applications because any pixel in an image will be correlated to other pixels in its vicinity and this correlation would be inversely proportional to the distance of pixels. Convolution operation will gather information from a pixel's vicinity to assign some properties to the pixel in form of numerical value. These Numerical values can form low-level features such as edges and corners in first layers and high-level features such as faces and cars in deeper layers."

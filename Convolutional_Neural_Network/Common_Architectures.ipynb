    "Simply described, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a type of Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network in which - some of - hidden layers are structured in such a way that their output on a given input is a convoluted version of input data using a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of Neural Networks are powerful in Image Analysis applications because any pixel in an image will be correlated to other pixels in its vicinity and this correlation would be inversely proportional to the distance of pixels. Convolution operation will gather information from a pixel's vicinity to assign some properties to the pixel in form of numerical value. These Numerical values can form low-level features such as edges and corners in first layers and high-level features such as faces and cars in deeper layers."

    "Creating a ConvNet, even the simplest one, requires some designing effort. The number of hidden layers, convolution kernel size, max pooling step size are just a few of the properties a ConvNet will have and from this step onward, everything will get more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of a ConvNet will have a direct effect on its capabilities. For example, shallow Neural Networks will not have enough non-linearity power to classify a big data space, but on the other hand, very deep neural network are hard to train because of vanishing gradient problem. This will result in an optimization problem. In other words, the architecture of the network will have a big effect on its capabilities. "
